Doing one language each day:

| Day | Language | Timings (s) | Comments |
| --- | -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 1 | Rust | P1: 0.01, P2: 0.17 | A bit verbose, but some cool modern features (interresting error handling, nice data structures, map/filter etc). Seems a bit like a mixture between Kotlin and C++. Slow compile times. Turning on compiler optimizations makes an order of magnitude difference in runtime (timings are with -O), slightly faster than an equivalent Python implementation. |
| 2 | Typescript(Node) | P1: 0.14, P2: 0.11 | Not as terrible to program in as expected, but still a bit wierd. Fun to try something a bit more event-based. Also slow compile times, even though it is (from my perspective) not doing much. Quite a bit slower than a similar Python implementation for part 1, roughly similar for part2. |
